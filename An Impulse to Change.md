Riding bikes has been a slice of my identity for the past two years and change. I've spent most of that time on my college campus, where the desire to ride different bikes on different terrains is supplanted by the need to have precisely one working commuter at all times. I'm only really a cyclist during breaks when I leap back home—a weekend here, a month there—into the arms of car-centric suburban paradise. Fr a few precious weeks each year, no longer enslaved by the need to ride, I'm free to explore the want to ride. 

Even when I'm home, between homework, family, personal projects, and rest, I have precious few hours to spend with bikes. But, for some reason, I often spend more time tinkering in my garage than I do riding. Before a ride, I sit around, dreaming up changes I could make, parts I could optimize—could my brakes use a bleed? would that parts bin derailleur work with that cassette? is my sag right? what if I tried friction again? Then I head to the garage, spend a couple hours on my latest harebrained scheme, and before I know it, it's too dark or cold or close to dinnertime to ride. 

Tinkering still lifts my mood at times. When that derailleur-shifter-cassette combo I thought of indexes perfectly after just a hair more B-tension, I rejoice. But when I have to stop because I put a drop bar on my hardtail and now the brakes don't work, I shake my fist and wonder, "Why'd I have to mess with it in the first place?"

If it gives me grief and costs me riding time, one might ask, why do I tinker? Why can't I just ride the working bike I have now? 

____

One explanation: I'm a dentist. If not financially, then at least spiritually: I like to buy, swap, and fix stuff more than I like to ride. 

Being a dentist, I shop recklessly for my perfectly working bikes. I spend more time than I'd like to admit on Craigslist and the Pinkbike buysell, scrounging for deals on parts. But when one arrives, I rip open the box, install it, and go right back to wondering what I might change next. My recklessly consumptive tendencies, my gluttony for bike parts, reminds me of a dentist with more money than sense. 

As for many dentists, the aesthetics of my bikes are paramount. All of my rides posted on Strava are accompanied by a bike picture. While most of my trails are filled with beautiful scenery, I rarely stop to take pictures—except one of my bike, resting against a tree. After I get back to my car, before gulping down water, taking my wheel off, or cleaning the chain grease off my calf, I upload the picture. Is this some sort of two-wheeled mating call? A plea for compliments on that new paint? Kudos-fishing? Whatever it is, I share this content-dumping habit with many dentists. 

I encounter these fellow dentists on bike review websites and forums. Most of the ten minutes between classes are spent staring down at my phone, jumping from NSMB to Weight Weenies to MEATEngines. I devour them at breakneck speed, skipping over phrases and sentences while looking for a review or thread I might enjoy. I never feel more like a dentist, than when I tear my eyes away, my mind swimming with trails and hacks and bikes I don't even want, more unsatisfied than when I started. 

But this can't explain one thing: the unparalleled feeling I get from finally ripping a feature I've had to walk a dozen times, from screaming down some singletrack as the sun sets. Bikes are nice, but they have nothing on riding, feeling the bike disappear under my feet, its parts and geometry and setup an afterthought. Riding my bike is a purer, happier experience than working on it, so I'm not the archetypal dentist who likes bikes more than they do riding. 

___

So, maybe I don't really want to tinker. If it gives me a decidedly worse experience than actually riding my bike, then maybe tinkering is just a habit I can't seem to shake. 

Tinkering produces more angst than joy. When a part doesn't work as expected or I fat-finger a wrench and strip a bolt, I sulk around for the rest of the day. And when something goes right, at best, I get a little kick of happiness. This lines up with the scientific consensus on dopamine: although many dopamine sources are good for you (exercise, sex, food), some activities constantly bombard you with it, until they become unsatisfying and yet addicting. Maybe using bike tools has become a chronic addiction, a quest to relive the rush from when I first picked up a torque wrench. 

Another widely publicized dopamine addiction is doomscrolling. Mindlessly scrolling through short-form content, blatantly designed to monetize your attention, is bad for you. Thankfully, on the days I work on bikes, my doomscrolling dwindles. But am I replacing one vice with another? Do I work on bikes when I don't really want to, because it activates the same addictive neural pathways that doomscrolling does? Has SRAMano's crack team of psychologists won out over Meta and ByteDance in the battle for my attention?

Maybe they have, but they can't replace the satisfaction I get from social interaction. Tinkering is a nonsocial activity, done alone in my garage, but riding is purely social. Even when I go riding alone, I pass people with a nod or help a downed rider with a tire plug. Working on a bike alone pales in comparison to the connections I make in these brief moments of camaraderie. 

Still, why do I go to such great lengths to tinker? I spend gallons of creative juices on it, learning CAD and painting and exploring deep corners of the internet to find out if this shifter-cassette-RD combo might shift. Can I really put so much work toward something I despise doing?

___

Probably not. There has to be some basic tendency that keeps me coming back to my garage. Perhaps it's the natural human desire to change stuff—to strive for a goal, working relentlessly to achieve it; and then to see, hold, and feel the tangible impact of that work. 

I fulfill this desire across my life, not just with bikes, and I'm not alone. Some of my most cherished moments of the past 15 years are working on projects around the house with my dad. Most weekends, we budget a couple hours for a project or two. We run to the hardware store, install a part upside down, swear at an inanimate object, install it the right way, lose a screw, swear again, and keep working until the job is done five hours later. Even though we both end up sweaty and frustrated, we always take a moment to step back and admire our work. There's an immeasurable satisfaction that comes from going from an idea to a finished product, whether it's a homemade planter box or a new derailleur cage. 

Our desire to impact the world around us isn't expressed solely through physical objects—it's present in everything we do. Many people work jobs they dislike for bosses they hate, but still find fulfillment in finishing tasks and hitting targets. Most hobbies—sports, games, time with friends—are working toward some goal, whether it's a KOM, Victory Royale, or a successful night out. Having kids allows you to transfer your knowledge to someone, so your experience lives on after you. We direct our efforts at objects, people, and ideas that we want to see changed and improved. When I work on my bike, I'm taking something I care about and trying to make it better. 

It helps that while most systems in our complex world feel too convoluted for one person to understand, I feel as if I know every part of my bike. I could spend ten years working to topple a corrupt government and feel as if I'd changed nothing, but ten minutes in my garage will improve my ride. It's comforting to be in control. 

___

The comfort zone isn't always a good place to be. If I never tried to change anything bigger than myself, I couldn't. Working in my garage 24/7 leaves no time for anything else. On the other hand, if I'm always obsessed with changing things, I can't enjoy the present. It never feels good to cancel a planned ride because my tinkering session went into overtime. 

Maybe the answer lies somewhere in between. I should follow the inspiration to change when it strikes, whether it's cutting down my bars or reinventing the housing market. But I can also find fulfillment in what doesn't have to change—a smile in the mirror, flowers blooming along the trail, and the pure joy in my dog's eyes as he licks the sweat off my face.
